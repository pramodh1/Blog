# Eat, Sleep, Game, Repeat

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/vXxWjz](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/vXxWjz).

A slightly-extended and responsive remake of a GIF by “ha_you_fell” from Alpha Coders (http://gifs.alphacoders.com/gifs/view/8223). Thought this would be a challenge for my experience with CSS animation.

However, I did use JavaScript for restarting the animations on window resize. If the animations were to continue running without it, the human would never have his position adjusted properly despite that it would in only Firefox. In other browsers, there seems to be a bug with animating translation in viewport units, and I never found anything about it on Can I Use.
