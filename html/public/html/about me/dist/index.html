					<li> Hi all, to whoever reading this, hope you're having a nice day. I am Pramodh, an amateur
						programmer but
						who is
						willing to work hard to become a professional at my field.</li>
					<p></p>

					<li> Ever since I was a child, I had a significant exposure to computers and I was fascinated
						about
						computers and
						it's day to day technological advancements which piqued my interests in computers even more.
					</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>
						I always have questioned how things work in the world of computers, for example: if in a
						game, how do non
						playable characters move? How does a car take damage when colliding with objects in game. I
						searched for
						its
						answer and the answer to that was simple. Programming . Each and every thing on the world of
						computers,
						smartphones, self-driving cars, Smart-TVs is programmed in a Programming Language.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li> The Programming Languages which caught my curiosity were Python and C++. Python because of
						it's
						simplicity and
						readability and C++ because of it's sheer power.
					</li>
					<p></p>
					<li> However, a few years ago I didn't possess any knowledge about Programming. But now I do,
						even though
						I'm
						amateur at it and I know I only scratched the tip of the iceberg , I'm excited to know more
						about it. I
						keep
						moving forward, with more drive, with more enthusiasm, and with more vigor.
					</li>
					<p></p>

					<li> That's all about me, we'll talk more about it, some other day, some other time üòÅüòÅ</li>
